# Trackgenix
Trackgenix is an app we are developing as part of a learning program. The main idea of the app's functionality is to keep track of the hours assigned to each employee on a project, having also the possibility to assign different roles and hour rates to each employee on each project.

## Week 02: Landing Page HTML
We coded the HTML structure of the landing page of the app, being the program's second assignment. It is based on the design we made on the first week. 

## Week 03: First CSS approach 
On this week we took the HTML structure we worked on for the landing page, created a styling sheet and styled it with CSS.
